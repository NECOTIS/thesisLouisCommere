Sound examples for the paper _Evaluation of depth sonifications for visual-to-auditory sensory substitution_

**BEFORE LISTENING TO THE SOUNDS, SET THE VOLUME AT THE LOWEST LEVEL, INCREASE IT IF NECESSARY WHEN LISTENING**

For a better sound quality, you can download the aiff files in the directory

Sounds correspond to a sonification of the depth from 0 to 1 meter:
