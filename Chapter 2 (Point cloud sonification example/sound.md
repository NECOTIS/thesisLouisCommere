See the paper "SONIFICATION OF 3D POINT CLOUDS FOR SUBSTITUTION OF VISION BY AUDITION
FOR BLIND USERS" (http://icad2018.icad.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/ICAD2018_paper_48.pdf) for more information. 

For the sonification: 

Coordinate system : 
the user is located at the position (x,y,z) = (0,0,0) and is looking in the direction of the X axis. The Y axis is directed on his left and the Z axis is directed on top.

File name convention for the synthesized point clouds:  

Shape_Pos_(x)-(y)-(z)_S_-s

Pos is the position (in the euclidean system) and S is the Size or Scaled (size of the object). A scale of 1 refers to :

- for the sphere a radius of 1, for the cube a side of 1 and for the pyramid and the cylinder a height one 1
